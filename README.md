# chatBot

Hello! Welcome to my Discord chatBot. This chatbot allows you to communicate what kind of games you like to play. And recommends what game to play based on the genre you give it. 

This bot can run on both Discord client or just on terminal if you don't want to set Discord up. 

On the Python main file, there will be a comment with "#chat(). Simply uncomment the statment. And comment out anything Discord related below it. If you wish to use the discord client, please run the python file while using the bot. Otherwise, the bot will not talk. :(

chatBot creates a knowledge base and picks the best possible game based on the database in the JSOM file that is embedded on the library. Using tools such as Tensorflow, TFlearn, Numpy Sci-Kit, and more packages to create training. Probabilistic models such as softmax and regression.
